# Eperimental Robotics Lab (EXROB) ROS workspace 

The aim of this project is to build a system able to play a robotic soccer match 1 vs 1
- Subtasks involved:
   - Perception: detecting a red ball,(eventually) the opponent and the goal (green)
   - Trajectory planning: controlling the velocity for reaching the target in an appropriate way
   - Task planning
   - Low level driver control

## Guidelines

Think about the possible general architecture of the system, defining the main blocks constituting your model.
- Develop a ROS Module that recognize a red object and track it.
- Start testing your code in a simulation environment
- Take a look to:
