README

Load the arduino sketch on the arduino, and execute the arduino_motors.py on the Raspberry (or PC). 
Using the terminal, you can manually insert the motor velocity (rps) and check the actual velocity of the motor.
The files work with the Connection Diagram shown in the pdf.

This can be the starting point for building a driver for moving the robot in all needed directions.
For example, if you need to move the robot forward, just set the same, positive, velocity for all motors. 
If you need to move on the right (or left) two motors should rotate in one direction and two motors should rotate in the opposite direction.

You can also rotate or move diagonally by selecting motors and directions.
